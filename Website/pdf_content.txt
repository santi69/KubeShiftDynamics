       Cloud Overspend
      Enterprises overspend 30-45% on Kubernetes infrastructure due
      to overprovisioning and inefficient resource allocation



       Engineering Overhead
      Platform teams spend 15-20% of their time manually reconciling
      FinOps initiatives with GitOps workflows

    Competitive Landscape
    Current Market Players
       Visibility-First Tools
      Kubecost, OpenCost, CloudZero
      Strong in cost visibility but weak in GitOps integration



       Automation-First Tools
      CAST AI, Spot.io, StormForge
      Strong in automation but bypass GitOps workflows



    The Market Gap

         The Critical FinOps-GitOps Integration Gap
              No existing solution effectively bridges the gap between FinOps objectives and GitOps workflows. Current tools either:
               Provide cost visibility but leave implementation to manual GitOps processes
               Automate cost optimization but bypass GitOps, causing configuration drift
               Lack deep capacity intelligence needed for true optimization
