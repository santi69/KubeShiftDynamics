# PoC Plan: GitOps-Native Kubernetes Cost Optimization

## 1. Executive Summary (The Investor's Lens)
The Kubernetes cost optimization market, projected to surpass $10 billion, is filled with tools that identify savings but fail at the last, most critical step: implementation. They burden DevOps teams with manual work, creating a "last-mile problem" that negates much of the potential ROI. This document outlines a 2-month, 2-developer Proof of Concept (PoC) to build an MVP that solves this problem. Our solution uses an AI engine to not only find savings but to autonomously and safely implement them by creating pull requests directly within a customer's existing GitOps workflow. Our core differentiator is an AI that can understand any Git repository's structure, find the right files to edit, and make precise changes. This PoC will de-risk the core technical challenge and prove we can solve a high-value problem for a sophisticated market segment. A successful PoC will demonstrate a clear path to a commercial product that can capture significant market share by offering tangible cost savings and dramatic operational efficiency.

## 2. Strategic Rationale & Product Vision (The Product Owner's Lens)
**The Problem**: DevOps and FinOps teams know they are overspending on Kubernetes. Existing tools give them a "what to fix" list, but the "how to fix" is a manual, error-prone process of updating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) files, which slows them down or fully autonomous and introduces drifts and risk.

**Our Vision**: To create an intelligent, trusted co-pilot for cloud infrastructure management that makes cost optimization a safe, autonomous, and zero-effort process.

**Why Our PoC Features Matter**:
* **Target the Biggest Spenders First (Workloads & Nodes)**: We focus on workload right-sizing and node instance optimization because they represent the largest and most common sources of cloud waste. A win here delivers immediate, high-impact value.
* **Speak the Market's Language (Terraform & Helm)**: By supporting the de facto standards for IaC, we ensure our MVP is relevant to a broad, existing user base from day one.
* **The AI is Our "Magic"**: Our core value proposition is not the recommendation, but the automated implementation. The AI's ability to navigate any repository structure is what makes our solution unique and scalable, eliminating the need for complex, per-customer configuration. Hence no vendor lockins, and customers are free to continue using their choice of GitOps toolings.
* **Pull Requests Build Trust**: We intentionally do not touch live infrastructure. By creating a pull request, we integrate seamlessly and safely into the user's existing review and deployment process (GitOps). This builds trust and lowers the barrier to adoption.

**PoC Success Criteria**:
* Successfully connect to a test EKS cluster and generate at least one valid workload and one valid node optimization recommendation.
* Successfully scan three different GitHub repositories with varying directory structures.
* For a given recommendation, automatically identify and modify the correct Terraform/Helm file in each of the three test repositories.
* Successfully generate a well-formed GitHub Pull Request for each modification, with a clear description of the proposed change.

## 3. Technical Plan & Architecture (The Developer's Lens)
**Objective**: Build a lean, functional MVP that proves the end-to-end workflow is technically feasible. The focus is on proving the core AI-driven modification logic, not on building a polished, scalable UI.

**Proposed Tech Stack**:
* **Backend**: Python with FastAPI (excellent for ML/AI integration and rapid API development).
* **AI/ML**: Utilize a combination of rule-based parsers (hcl-parser for Terraform, pyyaml for Helm) and a Large Language Model (LLM) for semantic understanding and code generation/modification. Frameworks like LangChain can orchestrate this.
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (for storing cluster/repo info and recommendations).
* **Frontend**: Minimalist UI using React with basic components. The goal is functionality, not aesthetics, for the PoC.
* **Cloud**: AWS for EKS connection and hosting the service itself.

**High-Level Architecture Flow**:
1.  **Connect**: User provides Kubeconfig/IAM credentials and a GitHub repository URL.
2.  **Analyze**: A backend service connects to the EKS API and Prometheus to gather metrics. It analyzes this data to generate optimization recommendations (e.g., "Change ng-main-app instance type to t4g.large").
3.  **Localize & Modify (The AI Core)**:
    * The service clones the specified GitHub repo.
    * It recursively scans the repo, looking for .tf and values.yaml files.
    * The AI engine uses a combination of file content analysis and the recommendation context (e.g., the resource name ng-main-app) to identify the target file(s).
    * It parses the file to locate and programmatically update the specific attribute (instance_type = "m5.large").
4.  **Propose**: The service uses the GitHub API to create a new branch, commit the change, and open a Pull Request.
5.  **Display**: The UI updates to show a link to the open PR.

**Month-by-Month Task Breakdown**:
* **Month 1 (Foundational Analysis)**:
    * **Week 1-2**: Set up backend service, database, and secure EKS connection logic. Develop the core analysis engine to poll metrics and generate JSON-based recommendations for both workloads and nodes.
    * **Week 3-4**: Build the minimalist React UI for cluster/repo registration. Create the API endpoints to serve recommendations to the frontend.
* **Month 2 (AI GitOps Integration)**:
    * **Week 5-6**: Focus entirely on the "Localize & Modify" logic. Implement the repo scanning, file identification, and code modification engine for Terraform first. This is the hardest part.
    * **Week 7**: Integrate the GitHub API to automate the Pull Request creation.
    * **Week 8**: Extend the modification logic to support Helm values.yaml files. Final integration, testing, and documentation for the PoC demo.

## 4. High-Level Scope & Phased Approach
*(This section remains largely the same but is now supported by the persona-specific details above.)*

### Month 1: Foundational Analysis & Recommendation Engine
* **Single Cloud Provider Focus**: Amazon EKS.
* **Secure Cluster Connection**: Via kubeconfig or IAM roles.
* **Core Analysis Service**: For workload and node optimization.
* **Simple Recommendation Engine**: Generate clear, actionable recommendations.
* **Basic API & Data Storage**: PostgreSQL and a simple REST API.
* **Minimalist Dashboard UI**: To register clusters and view recommendations.

### Month 2: The "Magic" - AI-Powered GitOps Integration
* **Git Repository Integration**: GitHub.
* **AI-Powered IaC Discovery and Modification**: The core innovation. Recursively scan, automatically identify, and pinpoint/modify code in Terraform and Helm files.
* **Automated Pull Request (PR) Creation**: The key output of the system.
* **UI Enhancements for GitOps**: A simple button to trigger the process and a link to the result.

## 5. What's Next: Roadmap to Public Preview Version v1.0

Following a successful PoC, the next 6-8 months of development with an expanded team will focus on maturing the platform into a robust, enterprise-ready public preview. The key investment areas will be:

### Optimization Engine

- **Noise Reduction:** Implement algorithms to group similar recommendations and reduce alert fatigue, preventing users from being spammed with too many minor suggestions.
- **Personalization & Relevancy:** Enhance the engine to learn from user actions (e.g., which PRs are accepted vs. rejected) to provide more targeted and relevant suggestions over time.
- **Advanced Optimizations:** Expand beyond right-sizing to include recommendations for spot instance usage, Reserved Instance/Savings Plan purchases, and idle resource cleanup.

### Connection & Architecture

- **Agent-Based Model:** Transition from a kubeconfig/IAM-based connection to a lightweight, secure agent deployed in the customer's cluster. This enables reliable egress-only communication, supporting private clusters and complex firewall configurations.
- **Database & Data Storage:** Implement intelligent data retention and auto-cleanup policies to prevent database bloat. Begin offloading historical metric data to cheaper, long-term storage like Amazon S3 for trend analysis.

### Frontend & User Experience

- **Identity Management:** Integrate with standard Identity Providers (IDPs) like OAuth2 (Google, GitHub) for secure and seamless user authentication.
- **Value-Oriented Dashboards:** Develop dashboards that track key performance indicators, such as:
  - Real-time and historical cost savings achieved.
  - Total number of automated PRs created to show manpower effectiveness.
  - Success rate of merged PRs from recommendations.

### Platform & Ecosystem Support

- **Multi-Cloud Expansion:** Add full support for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), providing a consistent optimization experience across all major cloud providers.
- **Expanded Git Provider Support:** Move from PATs to GitHub Apps for higher rate limits and better security. Add support for various GitHub hosting options (Public, Private, Self-Hosted, Enterprise) and other providers like GitLab and Bitbucket.

### AI & Intelligence

- **Granular Control:** Give users more control over the AI engine, including:
  - Whitelisting/blacklisting of specific resources, namespaces, or clusters.
  - Setting a minimum desired node count or preferred CPU families (e.g., Graviton).
  - Configuring a buffer (e.g., +20%) to be added on top of recommendations for critical applications.
- **IaC Best Practices:** The AI will analyze repository structure and IaC files to provide recommendations on aligning with industry best practices for better organization and maintainability.
- **Expanded IaC Tooling:** Broaden the AI's modification capabilities to include other popular tools like Kustomize and Pulumi.
- **Workflow Automation:** For non-production environments, provide an option to bypass the PR process and merge changes automatically, enabling rapid iteration for dev/test clusters.
